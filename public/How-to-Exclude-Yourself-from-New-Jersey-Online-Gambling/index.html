New Jersey jumped on this opportunity and quickly passed a bill legalizing sports betting within the state. But what happens if you don’t want to participate in the new NJ online gambling?</p>
<p>There are a couple of ways to exclude yourself from gambling on the state website. The first is to create an account on the site, and then opt out of gambling. To do this, go to settings and select the option that says “Do not allow me to gamble on this site.”</p>
<p>If you don’t have an account, you can also call 1-855-367-6542 (or 609-403-0900 from outside of New Jersey) and speak with a customer service representative. They will be happy to exclude you from gambling on the site.</p>
<p>Remember that even if you exclude yourself from online gambling, you can still place bets at a physical casino in New Jersey.</p>
<h1 id="Get-Yourself-Excluded-from-New-Jersey-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Get-Yourself-Excluded-from-New-Jersey-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Get Yourself Excluded from New Jersey Online Gambling"></a>Get Yourself Excluded from New Jersey Online Gambling</h1><p>Online gambling is now legal in the state of New Jersey, but there are ways to get yourself excluded from participating. If you don’t want to take part in online gambling, whether it’s for religious reasons or just because you don’t want to gamble, there are a few steps you can take.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is head over to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement website and download the Exclusion Request Form. This form can be filled out and submitted online or by mail. You’ll need to provide some personal information including your name, address, and Social Security number.</p>
<p>You’ll also need to provide an explanation for why you’d like to be excluded from online gambling. Some people may have a gambling addiction and want to stay away from all forms of gambling, while others may have religious convictions that prevent them from participating in online gambling. Whatever your reason, make sure to explain it clearly on the form.</p>
<p>Once the form is complete, you can submit it online or mail it in to the Division of Gaming Enforcement. They will review your request and let you know if it has been approved or denied. If your request is approved, you will be excluded from all forms of online gambling in New Jersey.</p>
<p>If you’re not comfortable submitting your personal information online, you can also call the Division of Gaming Enforcement at (609) 984-0900 and ask for a hard copy of the exclusion request form. They will mail it to you and you can fill it out and submit it by mail.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Self-Exclude-from-New-Jersey-Online-Gambling"><a href="#How-to-Self-Exclude-from-New-Jersey-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="How to Self-Exclude from New Jersey Online Gambling"></a>How to Self-Exclude from New Jersey Online Gambling</h1><p>If you are a New Jersey resident and want to self-exclude from any of the state’s online gambling sites, we have all the information you need. In this article, we will go over how to self-exclude from all New Jersey gambling sites, as well as how to exclude yourself from specific casinos or poker rooms.</p>
<p>To begin, you will need to access the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement’s self-exclusion program website. Once there, click on the “I Want To Exclude Myself” button and enter your personal information. Then, follow the instructions on the website to complete the process.</p>
<p>You will also be required to provide copies of two forms of ID, such as your driver’s license or passport. One ID must feature your photograph, while the other can be either a copy of your ID or a recent utility bill in your name.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that once you have self-excluded from New Jersey gambling sites, you will be banned from all licensed sites in the state for a minimum period of six months. You may also be subject to additional restrictions, such as being prohibited from entering any casino in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>If you would like to exclude yourself from specific New Jersey online casinos or poker rooms, you can do so by contacting those sites directly. Each site has its own procedures for excluding players, so be sure to review the terms and conditions carefully before requesting exclusion.</p>
<p>In most cases, you will need to provide your full name and date of birth, as well as copies of two forms of ID as mentioned above. Once again, it’s important to note that exclusion from one site does not apply to any other site operated by different companies within New Jersey.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the self-exclusion process or would like more information on how to stay safe while gambling online, please contact the NJ Division of Gaming Enforcement at (609) 984-0900 or visit their website at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.njdge.com/">www.njdge.com</a> .</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Remove-Yourself-from-New-Jersey-Online-Gambling"><a href="#How-to-Remove-Yourself-from-New-Jersey-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove Yourself from New Jersey Online Gambling"></a>How to Remove Yourself from New Jersey Online Gambling</h1><p>If you live in New Jersey and gamble online, you may be wondering how to remove yourself from the list of authorized players. Luckily, it’s a relatively simple process.</p>
<p>The first step is to contact the online gambling site directly and ask them to remove your information. They may require some proof of identification (e.g., a driver’s license or passport), so make sure to have that ready.</p>
<p>If the site refuses to remove you, or if you’re having difficulty getting through to them, you can contact the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) for assistance. The DGE is responsible for regulating all forms of gambling in New Jersey, including online casinos.</p>
<p>To get in touch with the DGE, you can call their toll-free number (1-866-225-7598) or send them an email at This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. .</p>
<p>In addition to contacting the online gambling site and the DGE, you can also contact your credit card company and ask them to block any transactions related to online gambling. This will help ensure that you don’t accidentally continue to gamble online without realizing it.</p>
