      UK Treasury Announces Plans to Slash Pokie Machine Tax Breaks

        <h1 id="UK-Treasury-Announces-Plans-to-Slash-Pokie-Machine-Tax-Breaks"><a href="#UK-Treasury-Announces-Plans-to-Slash-Pokie-Machine-Tax-Breaks" class="headerlink" title="UK Treasury Announces Plans to Slash Pokie Machine Tax Breaks"></a>UK Treasury Announces Plans to Slash Pokie Machine Tax Breaks</h1><p>The UK Treasury has announced plans to slash tax breaks for poker machine operators, in a bid to reduce the £1.5 billion annual cost of problem gambling. The changes, which are due to come into effect in April 2019, will see the amount operators can claim back on losses reduced from £2.25 per machine per day to just £0.50.</p>
<p>Speaking on the plans, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said: “These reforms will protect taxpayers from being taken advantage of by big casino companies and ensure that gambling is fair and responsible. The government is committed to ensuring that Gambling Commission regulations are effective at protecting people from harm, and that those who experience problems with gambling have access to the support they need.”</p>
<p>The new rules have been welcomed by campaigners who argue that they will help to combat problem gambling. But the move has drawn criticism from the gaming industry, which argues that it will damage investment and lead to job losses.</p>
<p>The Gambling Commission estimates that around 470,000 people in Britain are problem gamblers, costing the economy around £1.5 billion each year. In response to concerns about the impact of the proposed changes, the Treasury has said that it will invest an additional £10 million into support services for problem gamblers.</p>
<h1 id="Pokie-Slots-Could-be-Banned-in-the-UK"><a href="#Pokie-Slots-Could-be-Banned-in-the-UK" class="headerlink" title="Pokie Slots Could be Banned in the UK"></a>Pokie Slots Could be Banned in the UK</h1><p>The UK Gambling Commission is currently investigating the possibility of banning pokie slots in the country. This comes as a response to concerns that the machines are too addictive and can lead to gambling addiction problems.</p>
<p>Pokie slots are one of the most popular types of gambling in the UK, with around £13 billion wagered on them each year. However, there is concern that the machines are too addictive and can lead to gambling addiction problems.</p>
<p>In response to these concerns, the UK Gambling Commission is currently investigating the possibility of banning pokie slots in the country. A ban on pokie slots would be a major change for gambling in the UK, and it is not yet clear whether such a ban would be effective or practical.</p>
<h1 id="MPs-Call-for-Crackdown-on-‘Addictive’-Pokie-Slot-Machines"><a href="#MPs-Call-for-Crackdown-on-‘Addictive’-Pokie-Slot-Machines" class="headerlink" title="MPs Call for Crackdown on ‘Addictive’ Pokie Slot Machines"></a>MPs Call for Crackdown on ‘Addictive’ Pokie Slot Machines</h1><p>In a damning report released today, a group of MPs has called for a crackdown on so-called “addictive” poker machine (pokie) slot machines, citing their negative social and economic effects.</p>
<p>The report, compiled by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), urges the government to take swift action to address what it calls a “serious public health issue”.</p>
<p>“Poker machines are a scourge on our society,” said group chairperson, Baroness Walmsley. “They prey on the vulnerable, sucking up people’s life savings while ruining families and communities in the process.”</p>
<p>The report cites evidence that pokie machines are highly addictive, leading many people to develop compulsive gambling habits that can ruin their lives. It also points to the devastating social consequences of problem gambling, including family breakdowns, homelessness, and suicide.</p>
<p>“We need to take urgent action to protect people from these harmful machines,” said Baroness Walmsley. “That means tougher regulation, better enforcement, and more funding for support services.”</p>
<p>The MPs are calling on the government to introduce a new licensing system for pokie machines that would restrict their availability and allow for closer monitoring of their use. They also want gambling companies to be required to provide clear information about the risks of gambling addiction.</p>
<p>“These reforms are vital if we are to protect our communities from the damage caused by pokie machines,” said Baroness Walmsley. “I hope the government will act swiftly to implement them.”</p>
<h1 id="David-Cameron-Promises-to-‘Sort-Out’-Gambling-Addiction-Epidemic"><a href="#David-Cameron-Promises-to-‘Sort-Out’-Gambling-Addiction-Epidemic" class="headerlink" title="David Cameron Promises to ‘Sort Out’ Gambling Addiction Epidemic"></a>David Cameron Promises to ‘Sort Out’ Gambling Addiction Epidemic</h1><p>David Cameron has today pledged to take urgent action to address the growing problem of gambling addiction in the UK. The Prime Minister said that he was “determined to get a grip on this issue”, which he described as an “epidemic”.</p>
<p>Cameron’s announcement comes after a surge in the number of people seeking help for gambling addiction in recent years. According to figures from the NHS, the number of people seeking treatment for gambling addiction has increased by more than 60% since 2010.</p>
<p>In a speech in London, Cameron said that the government would be investing an additional £1 million into treatment services for gambling addicts. He also promised to work with the gambling industry to develop new measures to prevent and treat addiction.</p>
<p>“Gambling can be a fun and harmless pastime but for some people it can become a dangerous addiction,” said Cameron. “That’s why I am determined to take urgent action to address this epidemic and make sure that those affected get the help they need.”</p>
<p>Cameron’s announcement was welcomed by campaigners who have been calling for greater action to address the problem of gambling addiction. Harry Harpham, Labour MP for Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, said that it was “great news” that the government was taking action on gambling addiction.</p>
<p>“For too long, successive governments have turned a blind eye to the growing problem of gambling addiction,” said Harpham. “It’s great news that David Cameron is finally taking this issue seriously and is investing in treatment services for addicts.”</p>
<h1 id="Study-Shows-Britons-Lose-Over-£1-Billion-a-Year-on-Pokie-Machines"><a href="#Study-Shows-Britons-Lose-Over-£1-Billion-a-Year-on-Pokie-Machines" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows Britons Lose Over £1 Billion a Year on Pokie Machines"></a>Study Shows Britons Lose Over £1 Billion a Year on Pokie Machines</h1><p>According to recently released figures from the UK Gambling Commission, British players lost a staggering £1.4 billion on electronic gaming machines in 2016 - with the average player losing over £200 each. This represents a significant increase on the £1.2 billion lost in 2015, and suggests that Britons are increasingly hooked on pokie (slot) machines.</p>
<p>The figures are particularly worrying given that they come at a time when the government is considering cutting maximum stakes on pokies from £100 to just £2. This would leave many people who have become addicted to gambling with little opportunity to recoup their losses, and could lead to even more people suffering from problem gambling.</p>
<p>Problem gambling is a serious issue, and can have devastating consequences for those affected. It can cause financial problems, damage relationships, and lead to mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. In extreme cases it can even lead to suicide.</p>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution to the problem of problem gambling, but one measure that could help is tighter regulation of pokie machines. This could include limiting the amount that people can lose in a single sitting, or requiring that players make a deposit before they can start playing. Funds raised from such measures could be used to support those affected by problem gambling.</p>
<p>It is important that we take action now to prevent more people from becoming addicted to pokie machines, and helping those who are already struggling. Please sign this petition if you agree:</p>
