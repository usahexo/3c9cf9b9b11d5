#  Phillies Lead NL East as Sports Gambling Continues to Grow

The Philadelphia Phillies have been the surprise of the National League East, as they lead the division after six weeks of play. Gabe Kapler’s club has been a pleasant surprise, as they are currently 21-12 and sit four games ahead of the Washington Nationals.

The Phillies have been a good offensive team, as they rank fourth in the National League in runs scored. They have also been solid defensively, as they rank sixth in the NL in Defensive Runs Saved.

Offseason acquisition Jake Arrieta has been a major contributor for the Phillies, as he is 4-2 with a 2.16 ERA in seven starts. Other key contributors for the Phillies include Aaron Nola (3-2, 3.14 ERA), Odubel Herrera (.339 batting average), and Rhys Hoskins (.273 batting average, 13 home runs).

The Phillies success this season can be attributed to a number of factors. First and foremost, they are playing very good baseball and are outpacing their opponents thus far. Additionally, sports gambling has continued to grow in popularity, and this has helped to fuel interest in baseball. Bettors have taken notice of the Phillies potential this season and have been betting on them at high levels.

All indications are that baseball is continuing to experience growth in terms of both popularity and wagering activity. The Phillies currently lead the NL East standings and appear to be a good value bet for those interested in betting on them.

#  Braves Struggling in Early Part of Season as Sports Gambling Picks Up

One of the hottest topics in the sports world right now is gambling, as more and more states legalize it. For fans of baseball, this means taking a renewed interest in the Atlanta Braves. The Braves were projected by many to be one of the worst teams in baseball this year, so their poor performance early on in the season is not too much of a surprise. Bettors who are looking to make some money on the team will likely continue to do so as the season wears on.

The Braves got off to a terrible start, losing their first six games and nine of their first ten overall. They have since shown some signs of life, winning six of their last twelve games, but they are still well below .500 and well out of contention for a playoff spot. Their pitching staff has been especially bad, with an ERA over 5.00. Their offense has also been struggling, scoring just 3.6 runs per game (27th in MLB).

There have been a few bright spots for the Braves this year. Young players like Ronald Acuna Jr. and Ozzie Albies have shown promise and should only get better as they gain more experience. Freddie Freeman has been solid at the plate once again, batting .312 with 8 home runs. One player who has been a big disappointment is outfielder Nick Markakis, who is batting just .236 with no homers and only 10 RBIs through 38 games.

The Braves are unlikely to turn things around completely this year, but there is still time for them to improve. If you want to place some bets on them, there are plenty of opportunities available at reputable online sportsbooks like [site]. Just be sure to monitor their performance closely so you can jump on any good betting opportunities as they arise.

#  Mets and Marlins Battle for Bottom of NL East as Sports Bettors Urge Action

Two struggling National League East teams face off this weekend as the New York Mets host the Miami Marlins. Both clubs are coming off series losses, and the Mets (41-50) hold just a one-game lead over the Marlins (40-51) for last place in the division.

The sportsbooks don't seem to think much of either team, as both are listed as +130 underdogs to win the series. However, there is some action to be had on this matchup, with both teams offering some interesting betting opportunities.

The most likely outcome of this series is a three-game sweep by the Mets. New York is a -185 favorite to win three games in this matchup, while Miami is priced at +155 to take the series.

However, if you're looking for a upset, the Marlins offer some good value. Miami is a -115 favorite to win one game in this series, meaning a $100 bet would net you $85.50 profit if they were able to pull out an upset victory.

On the other side of things, if you're betting on the Mets, they offer relatively little value. A $100 bet on New York would only net you $115 profit if they were to sweep the Marlins.

So which team should you back in this matchup? If you're looking for an upset pick, go with Miami. They offer good value and could easily steal a game from the Mets. However, if you're just looking for an outright winner, back New York to sweep Miami 3-0

#  Who Will Win the National League East? Full Analysis Ahead of the Season

The National League East is one of the most competitive divisions in baseball. The Washington Nationals have won the division for the past two seasons, but they are not a lock to do so again in 2018. There are several teams in the division that could compete for the division title. Let's take a look at each team and see who has the best chance of winning the division.

Washington Nationals

The Washington Nationals are the clear favorites to win the division. They have won it two years in a row and they still have one of the best rosters in baseball. Their lineup is headlined by Bryce Harper and Max Scherzer, and they also have a strong bullpen. Their biggest weakness is their starting rotation, but they should still be good enough to win the division.

Atlanta Braves

The Atlanta Braves are building a young and talented roster that could compete for the division title in 2018. They have a strong lineup led by Freddie Freeman and Andrelton Simmons, and their pitching staff is led by young stars like Julio Teheran and Mike Foltynewicz. If their young players can live up to their potential, the Braves could be a force to be reckoned with this season.

Philadelphia Phillies

The Philadelphia Phillies made some big offseason moves, signing Jake Arrieta and Carlos Santana to bolster their lineup. They also made some improvements to their pitching staff, adding Pat Neshek and Tommy Hunter. If their new additions can help them improve on their 80-win season from last year, they could be contenders for the division title this season.

New York Mets

The New York Mets had a disappointing 2017 season, but they should be much better in 2018. They have a strong core of hitters led by Yoenis Cespedes and Noah Syndergaard is one of the best pitchers in baseball. If they can stay healthy, the Mets should be contending for a playoff spot this season.

Miami Marlins

The Miami Marlins are expected to be one of the worst teams in baseball this season. They traded away all of their stars over the offseason, leaving them with very little talent on their roster. They will likely struggle to win more than 50 games this season.
