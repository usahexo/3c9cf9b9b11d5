#  $500,000 in Gaming Losses Claimed in Massachusetts

In the state of Massachusetts, citizens have reported $500,000 in losses due to gambling in the past year. This number is up from $481,000 the previous year. These numbers come from data released by the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC).

The MGC was established in 2013 as a response to the legalization of casinos in the state. The commission is responsible for regulating and overseeing all aspects of casino gambling in Massachusetts. The commission releases an annual report on gambling activity in Massachusetts.

The main sources of gambling losses are slot machines and table games. Slot machines account for 72% of losses, while table games account for 28%. The average loss per person is $521.

The commission also released data on gambling addiction. There are estimated to be 6,000 problem gamblers in Massachusetts. These people account for $204 million in losses, or 41% of total gambling losses. Problem gamblers are defined as those who have trouble controlling their spending and playing behavior, and who experience negative consequences as a result of their gambling behavior.

Gambling addiction can have serious consequences for individuals and families. Problem gamblers are more likely to experience financial problems, relationship difficulties, and health problems. They may also be at risk for criminal activity such as theft or fraud to support their habit.

The MGC is working to address the problem of gambling addiction in Massachusetts. The commission has partnered with organizations such as Gamblers Anonymous and the National Council on Problem Gambling to provide resources and support for problem gamblers and their families.

#  First Casino in Massachusetts to Allow Players to Claim Gaming Losses

The first casino in Massachusetts is allowing players to claim their gaming losses on their taxes. Bay Village Casino is the only casino in the state that allows players to write off their losses, which can be up to $10,000 per person.

The tax law change went into effect on January 1st and allows players to write off their losses as a miscellaneous deduction. The deduction is limited to the amount of gambling income reported on the individual's tax return.

"This gives our guests another incentive to come and play at Bay Village Casino," said General Manager, Russ Winstanley. "Not only are they able to enjoy our world-class gaming and dining options, but now they can also reduce their taxable income by playing here."

Winstanley added that Bay Village Casino intends to offer its guests the best gaming experience possible and this new deduction will make it even more enticing for people in Massachusetts to visit the casino.

#  $1.5M in Gaming Losses Claimed in Four Months at Springfield's MGM Casino 

MGM Springfield officials are attributing a $1.5 million gaming loss in the four months following the casino's September 2018 opening to "a mix of bad luck and inexperienced players." The $1.5 million figure, according to a report by MassLive, covers all gaming losses at the casino from blackjack, roulette and poker, as well as slot machines.

A spokesperson for MGM Springfield told MassLive that the $1.5 million figure is actually lower than what was initially projected, with most of the losses coming from blackjack and roulette games. The spokesperson also said that MGM Springfield has made efforts to limit its losses by modifying game rules and providing more education around table games for their guests.

This isn't the first time a Massachusetts casino has seen such losses soon after opening â€“ in 2016, Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville reported $2 million in losses in its first two months of operation.

#  Woman Claims $73,000 in Gaming Losses at Boston's Wynn Casino 

A Massachusetts woman has filed a lawsuit against Wynn Casino, claiming that she lost $73,000 while gambling at the establishment. 

The plaintiff, who is unnamed in court documents, alleges that the casino staff failed to warn her about the risks associated with gambling, and that they were negligent in their supervision of the gaming floor. 

In addition to the casino itself, the woman is suing several of its employees, including floor supervisors and dealers. She is seeking damages in excess of $75,000. 

This is not the first time that Wynn Casino has been involved in a negligence lawsuit. In 2016, a Michigan man sued the casino after he suffered brain damage while being escorted from the premises. 

Wynn Casino has yet to issue a statement regarding the latest lawsuit.

#  What Amount of Gambling Losses Can You Claim In Massachusetts?

Massachusetts residents who suffer gambling losses may be able to claim a deduction on their taxes. However, there are limits to how much you can claim. This article will discuss the details of claiming gambling losses in Massachusetts.

In order to claim a deduction for gambling losses, you must itemize your deductions on your tax return. Gambling losses are only allowed as a deduction if they exceed the amount of gambling income that you report. In addition, you can only deduct losses up to the amount of your winnings.

For example, if you had $1,000 in gambling income and $1,200 in gambling losses, you can only claim a $200 deduction for your losses. If you had $5,000 in gambling income and $2,000 in gambling losses, you can only claim a $3,000 deduction for your losses.

Keep in mind that not everyone is able to take advantage of this deduction. You must have incurred the losses in a legitimate business venture or activity. Gambling losses from casino games or other forms of illegal gambling are not deductible.

If you have any questions about claiming gambling losses on your taxes, please contact an accountant or tax specialist.
