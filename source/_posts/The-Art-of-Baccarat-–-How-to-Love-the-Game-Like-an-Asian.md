#  The Fascinating History of Baccarat and Why Asians Love It

Baccarat is typically thought of as a European game, but its true origins are in Asia. The first mention of baccarat was in a 15th century book about Chinese games of chance. From there, the game spread to Europe, where it was popularized by the French.

Today, baccarat is one of the most popular casino games in Asia, and especially in Macau. In fact, more than two-thirds of all the revenue from Macau's casinos comes from baccarat games. So what is it about this game that has made it so popular in Asia?

There are several reasons why Asians love baccarat. First, the gameplay is relatively simple and easy to understand. All you need to do is bet on either the player or banker hand, and then draw cards until one hand has a value of 9 or higher. This makes for an exciting and fast-paced game that doesn't require any complicated strategy or betting systems.

Second, baccarat offers some of the best odds in the casino. The house edge is just 1.06%, which is much lower than games like blackjack or craps. This means that players have a better chance of winning money when they play baccarat.

Finally, baccarat has a long history and tradition behind it. It's been around for centuries and has been played by some of the most famous people in history. This gives the game an air of sophistication and prestige that other casino games can't match.
