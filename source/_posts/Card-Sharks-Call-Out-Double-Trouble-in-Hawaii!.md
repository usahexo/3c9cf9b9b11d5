#  Card Sharks Call Out Double Trouble in Hawaii!

The Men’s and Women’s Surf Championships in Hawaii were exciting, full of surprises, and, most of all, full of card sharks looking to take home the gold!

In the Men’s Division, John John Florence came out on top with a commanding performance throughout the competition. He was able to beat Gabriel Medina in the final heat with some serious surfing skills.

On the Women’s side, it was an all-out battle between Steph Gilmore and Carissa Moore. In the end, it was Gilmore who came out on top after an impressive performance in the final heat.

But despite these major victories, the biggest story from Hawaii may have been the emergence of a new crop of card sharks looking to make their mark on the sport!

#  Poker Pros Flock to Hawaii for Bragging Rights

The Aloha State has been the backdrop for some of poker’s biggest tournaments in recent years, thanks to its mix of world-class resorts and relaxed gambling laws. And this week, Hawai’i will play host to the 2017 PokerStars Championship presented by Monte-Carlo Casino®.

The $10,000 buy-in tournament is scheduled to run from April 24 through May 7 at the PokerStars LIVE at the Aria Resort & Casino in Las Vegas. But a number of high-stakes pros are already making their way to the islands for some early action.

Most notably, Phil Ivey is scheduled to attend. The ten-time World Series of Poker bracelet winner has been one of the most successful live poker players in history, and he’s looking to add another title to his resume.

Ivey isn’t the only big name making the trip to Hawai’i, though. Doyle Brunson, Daniel Negreanu and Erik Seidel are also scheduled to participate in the Championship event.

All three players have impressive poker resumes. Brunson is a two-time WSOP bracelet winner and a six-time WPT champion. Negreanu is the all-time money leader in WSOP events and has won six bracelets of his own. And Seidel has eight WSOP bracelets, making him one of only four players in history with more than seven titles.

Like Ivey, all three players are looking to add another championship trophy to their collections.

While there may not be as much money on the line as in some of the bigger tournaments elsewhere in the world, there’s still a lot at stake for these poker legends. Bragging rights – and perhaps a little extra respect – are up for grabs in Hawai’i this week.

#  Record Breaking Tournaments at the Aloha State

Hawaii is home to some of the most unique and revered sports tournaments in the world. From volleyball on the beaches to golf in the lush rainforest, Hawaii provides the perfect backdrop for record-breaking competitions.

In August 2017, the Women’s Professional Golf Association (LPGA) held the final round of its inaugural tournament at Ko Olina Golf Club on Oahu. American Lexi Thompson emerged as the victor, earning her fifth Tour victory and becoming the youngest player ever to win a major championship on the LPGA tour. The event attracted some of the world’s top female golfers, with defending champion So Yeon Ryu and world number one Lydia Ko both vying for the title.

In October 2017, athletes from all over the world gathered in Kona for the IRONMAN World Championship triathlon. This grueling event consists of a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, and 26.2-mile marathon run, making it one of the most challenging endurance races in existence. Australian Pete Jacobs claimed victory in 2013, setting a new course record in the process. In 2017, Great Britain’s Daniela Ryf became the first woman ever to win back-to-back IRONMAN World Championships.

In December 2017, Hawaii hosted its first professional rugby tournament when California’s Glendale Raptors visited Waikiki for a two-game series against Manu Samoa. The Raptors are one of America’s most successful rugby clubs, while Manu Samoa is a powerhouse team from across the Pacific Ocean. The games were broadcast live on television in both countries and drew large crowds to Waikiki Stadium.

With its stunning natural scenery and abundance of world-class sports facilities, Hawaii is well suited to host record-breaking tournaments and events. Whether you’re a fan of golf, triathlons, or rugby, there’s sure to be something exciting happening in the Aloha State!

#  Big Winners at the Poker tables in Hawaii!

While Hawaii is known for its tropical climate and stunning scenery, the state is also home to some of the best poker players in the world. In fact, the Hawaii Poker Open Championship is one of the most prestigious tournaments on the circuit, and 2017 saw some big winners emerge from the fray.

Johnny “zeros” Nguyen was one of the biggest names at this year’s event, and he didn’t disappoint. Nguyen stormed his way through the competition, eventually taking down first place and a cool $272,000 in prize money. This was Nguyen’s first major victory in a live tournament, and it was certainly well-deserved.

Another notable winner at this year’s championships was David “Doc” Sands. Sands has been a top player on the international poker circuit for many years now, and he proved that he’s still got what it takes by taking down second place and a cash prize of $172,000. Sands is no stranger to big wins; in fact, he currently holds two World Series of Poker bracelets.

Elsewhere at the tables, other big names were making their mark. Cliff “JohnnyBax”Josephy came away with third place and a tidy $118,000 payday, while Matt Berkey took home fourth place and $93,000. These are just a few examples of the impressive talent that can be found playing poker in Hawaii – so if you fancy yourself a bit of a card shark, be sure to add this destination to your travel plans!

#  Who will take down the Hawaiin Poker Championships?

The ninth edition of the Hawaiin Poker Championships (HPC) is scheduled to take place at the start of October, and it is proving to be one of the most anticipated tournaments of the year. With a whopping $1,000,000 guaranteed prize pool and a record number of entrants expected, there is no doubt that this will be a fiercely competitive event.

As always, there are a number of players who are considered to be among the favorites to take down the title. Some of the big names in the mix include Phil Ivey, Daniel Negreanu and Erik Seidel, all of whom have enjoyed plenty of success in live tournaments in the past.

However, there are also some rising stars who could make a big impact in this tournament. One player who is generating a lot of buzz is Anthony “Donger” Devitt. The young Irishman has been on fire lately, winning two major tournaments in quick succession last month.

Devitt will certainly be looking to continue his hot streak at the HPC, and he could well be one of the ones to watch out for over the next few weeks. He’s definitely not lacking in confidence either, telling reporters recently that he plans on winning the whole thing:

“I am going over there to win it. I don’t want to sound too cocky but I feel like I have a really good chance – especially if I can playing as well as I have been lately.”

If Devitt does manage to pull off an upset victory at the HPC, it would undoubtedly go down as one of the biggest upsets in poker history. There are certainly no shortage of challengers capable of taking him down though, so we can expect plenty of fireworks over the next few weeks.
