#  What is debet?

Debet is an accounting term used to describe an increase in a company's liabilities. The term is most commonly used when discussing short-term liabilities, such as accounts payable and notes payable.

A company's debet will increase when it enters into a transaction that results in the company owing money to another party. For example, if a company buys supplies from a supplier on credit, its debet will increase by the amount of the purchase. This is because the company now owes the supplier money for the supplies.

#  What was the role of Mark Twain in the foundation of Valencia CF?

The prominent American author and humorist, Mark Twain, had a role in the foundation of Valencia CF. Back in 1919, a group of Americans led by Twain helped to create the club. This was possible through the intervention of American ambassador to Spain at the time, Worthington Chauncey Ford.

Ford played an instrumental role in getting the group together and helping them to get the club off the ground. The group were able to gather enough funding and found a suitable location for their new team. The team played their first official match in May 1919 against Barakaldo CF.

Twain had been a fan of football since he was young and was keen to see it grow in popularity in America. He saw football as a way to bring people together and believed that it could have a positive impact on society as a whole. This is what drove him to help form Valencia CF and it’s something that the club still stands for today.

Over the years, Valencia CF has gone from strength to strength and has become one of the biggest clubs in Europe. The club has won numerous trophies over the years, including La Liga and Copa Del Rey titles. They are also one of only three clubs ever to have won both La Liga and Champions League trophies.

The success of Valencia CF would not be possible without the hard work of everyone involved, including Mark Twain. His contribution to the club is something that will always be remembered and we can be proud that he was part of our history.
