In addition to the luxurious gaming experience, Vegas VIP Gold players also enjoy access to some of the best entertainment in Las Vegas.

#  How do I play the Vegas VIP Gold game? 

The Vegas VIP Gold game is a casino game that allows you to experience the high life of Las Vegas. The game is simple to play: all you have to do is choose whether a card is higher or lower than the one that has been revealed. If you guess correctly, your prize doubles. If you make a mistake, then you lose everything.

The Vegas VIP Gold game is available at all online casinos that offer games from Pragmatic Play. To get started, visit the website of your chosen casino and click on the "Vegas VIP Gold" icon. You will be taken to a new page where you can choose how many coins you want to bet per round. The minimum bet is €0.01 and the maximum bet is €10.00. Once you have decided on your bet, click on the "Play" button and the first round will begin.

During each round, two cards will be displayed - one at the top of the screen and one at the bottom. Your task is to choose whether the card at the top of the screen is higher or lower than the card at the bottom of the screen. If you choose correctly, your prize will be doubled; if you choose incorrectly, then you will lose all of your winnings from that round.

When you have finished a round, either by winning or losing, you will be given the opportunity to gamble your winnings or to collect them and move on to the next round. Gambling your winnings means that you can try to double them again; however, if you lose this second gamble then you will lose everything that you have won in that round. If you would rather not risk losing your winnings, then clicking on "Collect" will take you straight to the next round without having to gamble anything.

The aim of Vegas VIP Gold is simple: to achieve as high a score as possible before losing all of your money! Good luck!
